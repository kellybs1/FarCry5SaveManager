# FarCry5SaveManager

A program to backup and manage multiple Far Cry 5 savegames on Windows.

### Use

Make your own backup of "C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\savegames" or your equivalent uPlay savegames location before running.

Don't run the application while Far Cry 5 is running; it'll break stuff.

2) Select your Ubisoft Unique ID


3) Choose to backup the save in that location


4) Launch FC5


5) Start new game


6) Quit FC5


7) Back up the new save


Now, to restore

1) Click the Ubisoft ID you want to restore to


2) Click the save game you want to restore


3) Click the Load Save button... **WARNING**: This will overwrite your current save whether it's backed up or not 


Then...


Close application and run Far Cry 5.
